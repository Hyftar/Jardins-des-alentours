    what_is_jda1: "Jardin Des Alentours is the meeting grounds of a community interested in the local production of
                      fruits and vegetables. Whether you are invested in sourcing your produce near home, are an
                       enthusiastic gardener or simply seek out this platform as an informational tool,
                       Jardin Des Alentours offers you the possibility to share, exchange and link up with like-minded
                       individuals around you!"
    what_is_jda2: "By joining this community, you promote agricultural interest around you and partake in environmentally sustainable practices,
                      all while enjoying yourself!"
    a_gesture1: "Many of us try to promote seasonal local food markets whenever possible. However, this isn't always possible and that's why
                      we want to help! Whether it's to find your place within the agricultural community or to find environmentally friendly actions that
                      are accessible to you, we've got your back!"
    a_gesture2: "Most local and foreign fresh produce found in conventional grocery stores, often offered year-round,
                      leave a sizeable carbon footprint and semi-permanent damage to agricultural land. This is why it remains
                       at our advantage to produce as locally as possible, in our own backyards even, where we can keep
                       a watchful eye on our produce and have a good time!"
    a_community_matter1: "Jardins Des Alentours regroups multiple communities with various interest, whether it is with enthusiasm regarding a specific fruit or vegetable,
                          or geographic position, which plays a key part in the culture of any produce. "
